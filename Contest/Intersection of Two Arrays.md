Given two integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, return an array of their intersection[^1]. Each element in the result must be unique and you may return the result in **any order**.

## Intuitive Solution

According to the definition of **intersection**[^1], we need to find the common values in both arrays. Additionally, according to the problem statement, these values should be **unique**.

> We don't need to maintain the original order of the values, nor do we need to consider elements between them â€” we are not looking for subarrays.

Now, let's determine how we can check whether a value from the `nums1` array also appears in `nums2`.

> It is sufficient to check if a value is common in only one direction.

Since the result array should contain only unique values, we can store all elements from `nums1` in a set (`memo`). Then, as we iterate through `nums2`, we check whether each value exists in the set. If it does, we remove it from the set and add it to the result array.

> We can be sure that the values added to the result are unique because of the `set` structure.

```python
def intersection(self, nums1: List[int], nums2: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    res = []
    memo = set(nums1)
    for num in nums2:
        if num in memo:
            res.append(num)
            memo.remove(num)
    return res
```

## Set Intersection

According to the problem statement, we can simply use Python's built-in `set` structure and its intersection operator.

```python
def intersection(self, nums1: List[int], nums2: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    return list(set(nums1) & set(nums2))
```
