Xray is a modern and modular proxy platform designed to enable secure, flexible, and censorship-resistant internet access. It builds upon the ideas pioneered by V2Ray and enhances them with additional features, optimizations, and protocol support. Its core architecture is extensible and suitable for advanced tunneling applications across varied network environments.

## Client–Server Model

At the core of Xray’s functionality is the client-server model. The client, typically running on a local device, forwards traffic through an encrypted tunnel to a remote server, often hosted on a VPS. Once the server receives the traffic, it forwards it to the intended internet destination. This arrangement allows users to bypass network restrictions, avoid deep packet inspection, and control traffic routing with precision.

## Supported Protocols

Xray supports a range of transport protocols, each designed with different goals in mind:

- **VMess** includes built-in authentication and traffic obfuscation to resist detection.
- **VLESS** strips encryption from the protocol itself, relying on TLS or Reality for security and offering more flexibility.
- **Trojan** mimics standard HTTPS sessions, making it harder to distinguish from regular traffic and easier to deploy with minimal configuration.
- **Shadowsocks**, while less emphasized in Xray compared to legacy tools, remains available for basic encryption and speed.

Each protocol is suitable for specific network environments and threat models.

## Transport Layers

Xray decouples the tunneling protocol from the transport layer. This enables users to pair any proxy protocol with different transmission methods depending on their needs. Supported transport layers include:

- **TCP** for straightforward connections.
- **WebSocket (WS)** and **gRPC** for hiding traffic inside commonly used protocols.
- **QUIC** for low-latency multiplexing.
- **XTLS / Reality (Vision)** for modern TLS-based obfuscation that avoids fingerprinting.

These layers can help evade censorship or improve performance over unstable networks.

## Privacy and Encryption

Traffic between the client and server is encrypted, shielding content from ISPs and other intermediaries. In protocols like VMess and VLESS, user IDs or UUIDs are used to authenticate and authorize clients. When layered with TLS or Reality, traffic becomes nearly indistinguishable from regular HTTPS, making blocking more difficult.

Routing features allow traffic to be split based on domains, IPs, or protocols, so that sensitive traffic can be tunneled while less critical data exits normally. This gives users flexibility in how much of their traffic is protected.

## DNS Considerations

One of the most important, yet frequently overlooked, aspects of proxy security is DNS resolution. Xray can forward DNS queries through the tunnel to prevent DNS leaks. This ensures that domain lookups are not exposed to the local network or ISP.

In addition to encrypted DNS, Xray’s routing engine can resolve domains remotely and apply domain-based rules before establishing outbound connections.

## Anonymity Caveats

It is important to note that Xray does not offer anonymity in the same way as tools like Tor. While it encrypts traffic and hides endpoints from intermediate observers, it does not prevent correlation of client activity or obfuscate identity on its own. For use cases requiring full anonymity, Xray must be combined with other layers of protection.

## Performance Factors

Tunnel performance depends on several variables:

- Geographic distance between client and server affects latency.
- Transport layer choice (e.g., QUIC vs TCP) influences throughput and stability.
- Server resources such as CPU, bandwidth, and I/O capacity determine how much concurrent traffic can be handled.

Multiplexing transports like gRPC or QUIC can reduce connection overhead, especially under conditions of packet loss or high latency. Lightweight configurations like VLESS+Reality tend to perform better under constrained conditions.

## Use Cases

Xray is widely adopted among users who require secure internet access in restrictive environments, researchers studying internet censorship, developers building custom routing logic, and privacy-conscious individuals seeking control over traffic flows.

Its JSON configuration system allows for precise control over every component, from transport protocols and ports to DNS strategy and outbound routing behavior. This makes it highly adaptable across a wide range of deployment models, from simple local tunneling to complex multi-hop routing setups.
