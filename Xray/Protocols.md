Xray supports several tunneling protocols, each designed with a particular focus. Together they form a versatile toolkit for resisting censorship, improving privacy, and adapting to different network conditions. While their purposes overlap, the way they handle authentication, encryption, and disguise varies.

## VMess

VMess was the first protocol introduced in the V2Ray ecosystem and remains central in Xray. It integrates both authentication and obfuscation into its design. Each client is validated using a unique UUID, which prevents unauthorized access. At the same time, the protocol disguises its traffic to resist inspection.

- **Authentication**: clients connect with UUIDs.
- **Obfuscation**: traffic patterns are disguised to make detection more difficult.

These properties make VMess well suited for restrictive networks where detection is likely.

## VLESS

VLESS was created as a streamlined successor to VMess. Instead of embedding encryption inside the protocol, it delegates security to external layers such as TLS or Reality. This design makes VLESS lighter, faster, and easier to adapt to new techniques of censorship resistance.

- **No built-in encryption**: relies on TLS/Reality.
- **Efficiency**: reduced overhead compared to VMess.
- **Flexibility**: integrates naturally with modern obfuscation layers.

VLESS is now widely regarded as the default choice for high-performance Xray deployments.

## Trojan

Trojan takes a different approach by mimicking ordinary HTTPS traffic. To an observer, its sessions look identical to a user visiting a secure website. This makes Trojan particularly useful in environments where blending in with normal traffic is more effective than advanced obfuscation.

- **Mimics HTTPS**: indistinguishable from web browsing.
- **Simple deployment**: works smoothly with existing HTTPS infrastructure.

Its strength lies in stealth and ease of setup rather than configurability.

## Shadowsocks

Shadowsocks predates Xray but continues to be supported. It provides a minimalistic approach, focusing on fast symmetric encryption with very little overhead. While it lacks advanced authentication and disguise, its speed makes it attractive in less hostile environments.

- **Lightweight**: simple and efficient.
- **Fast**: low processing cost compared to other protocols.

Shadowsocks is suitable when speed is prioritized over resistance to inspection.

## Choosing a Protocol

Each protocol represents a different balance of performance, security, and disguise. VMess provides robust authentication and obfuscation, VLESS offers efficiency and adaptability through TLS or Reality, Trojan hides inside the normal patterns of HTTPS, and Shadowsocks delivers fast and lightweight encryption. Selecting the right one depends on whether the priority is stealth, throughput, or simplicity.
