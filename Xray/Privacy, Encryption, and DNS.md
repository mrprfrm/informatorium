Privacy in Xray is achieved by combining several mechanisms that work together to conceal user activity from surveillance and censorship. Authentication ensures only authorized clients can connect, encryption hides the contents of traffic, and camouflage makes connections resemble ordinary web use. Routing and DNS handling further determine how much metadata is exposed. These features give Xray strong privacy properties, while making clear that it is not intended to provide full anonymity like multi-hop systems such as Tor.

## Client Authentication

At the core of privacy is the question of who is allowed to connect. Xray addresses this through protocol-level authentication.

VMess now requires **AEAD** (Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data), which protects handshake data against replay and passive analysis. Earlier, legacy headers were easier to parse, but AEAD closes that gap by encrypting more of the session metadata.

VLESS takes a different approach: it relies on a **UUID** for client identity but deliberately avoids embedding encryption inside the protocol itself. Instead, it is meant to be paired with strong transport-level encryption such as TLS or REALITY. This separation keeps the protocol lean and flexible, but places responsibility on the transport layer to maintain confidentiality.

## Session Confidentiality and Camouflage

Once authenticated, the next concern is how traffic looks on the wire. Even if encrypted, some tunnels are easy to recognize.

With **TLS**, **XTLS**, or **REALITY**, a VLESS session is almost indistinguishable from ordinary HTTPS. REALITY is particularly notable because it reuses the Server Name Indication (SNI) of a legitimate domain, eliminating obvious fingerprints while maintaining forward secrecy. This raises the cost of censorship: blocking the tunnel would require blocking real web services at the same time.

For environments where blocking is aggressive, Xray also supports running these protocols over **WebSocket** or **gRPC** behind content delivery networks. By blending into CDN traffic, tunnels inherit the ubiquity of mainstream web platforms, making them harder to isolate without causing widespread disruption.

## TLS Fingerprinting

Even when TLS is used, observers can sometimes identify a client by the unique characteristics of its handshake. This process, known as TLS fingerprinting, can reveal that a connection is not a browser but a proxy tool.

To counter this, Xray integrates **uTLS**, a library that allows the client to mimic the TLS handshake of popular browsers like Chrome or Firefox. By doing so, the tunnel traffic looks more like a normal web session. However, fingerprints evolve over time, and static configurations may eventually stand out. Rotating or updating fingerprints is therefore an important part of maintaining privacy.

---

## Routing Scope

Privacy also depends on how much traffic passes through the tunnel. Xray gives fine-grained control over routing, letting users decide which domains, IP ranges, or protocols should be sent through the proxy. Sensitive activities can be protected, while routine or low-risk traffic can be left direct.

This approach reduces unnecessary overhead and allows the tunnel to focus on flows that truly need protection. It also interacts with DNS resolution: users can decide whether names should be resolved locally, remotely, or strictly within the tunnel.

---

## DNS Privacy

Unencrypted DNS queries can undermine the privacy of any tunnel, as they reveal which sites the user is visiting even if traffic content is hidden.

Xray mitigates this risk with a **built-in DNS system** that can forward queries through the tunnel. Combined with encrypted upstream resolvers such as DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) or DNS-over-TLS (DoT), this keeps lookups private from the local network and internet service provider.

Careful configuration is required: in some cases, misrouted or invalid domains may still leak to local resolvers. Testing with both valid and nonexistent domains is a practical step to verify that DNS queries are consistently protected.

---

## Conclusion

Privacy in Xray results from several interconnected features: authenticated access, encrypted and camouflaged sessions, mitigation of TLS fingerprinting, selective routing, and tunneled DNS. Together, they prevent intermediaries from inspecting or selectively blocking traffic. At the same time, Xray does not provide anonymity on its own. For use cases that require identity concealment in addition to privacy, it should be combined with systems specifically designed for that purpose.
