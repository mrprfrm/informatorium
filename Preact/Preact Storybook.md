For smaller projects, such as widgets for admin panels or embeddable components like custom date pickers or selects, it is often reasonable to use a more atomic framework that provides sufficient reactivity without the full overhead of React. One such option is Preact. It takes approximately 3 KB on load and offers a React-like API for building isolated components.

To simplify development and enable isolated component previews, Storybook can be used as a UI kit tool. Combined together, this setup uses Preact with Storybook and Vite under the hood.

This note provides a quick guide for setting up the environment from scratch.

## Dependencies

- Yarn 3+
- Preact
- Storybook
- Vite

## Initialization

In this section, the project is initialized using CLI tools and all required dependencies are installed.

### Node modules prerequisites

Before starting, note that Yarn PnP may not be compatible with many LSP servers, including `typescript-language-server`, since PnP bypasses node_modules and uses an isolated resolution mechanism that LSP servers often don't recognize. To avoid these issues and stick with the familiar node_modules convention, configure Yarn to use the node-modules linker:

```bash
yarn config set --home nodeLinker node-modules
```

### Create project

Initialize the project with Vite:

```bash
yarn create vite project --template preact-ts
```

This installs all required addons and presets for Preact with Vite.

Next, move inside the project root and set up Storybook:

```bash
cd project/
yarn create storybook
```

Follow the CLI instructions. After configuration completes, Storybook will attempt to launch but will fail with the following errors:

```bash
React is not defined
```

## The Error Fix

These errors originate from Viteâ€™s default JSX handling, not from Storybook itself.

Vite applies automatic JSX transformation, assuming React is available at runtime. Since React is not installed, Vite throws a `ReferenceError`.

To fix this, Vite must be configured to handle JSX properly.

First, install `@vitejs/plugin-react` as a development dependency:

```bash
yarn add -D @vitejs/plugin-react
```

Then create or update `vite.config.js`:

```javascript
import { defineConfig } from "vite";
import react from "@vitejs/plugin-react";

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()],
});
```

This ensures Vite handles JSX transformations correctly while using Preact components.

### Broken aliasing

During Storybook startup, we may encounter the following error:

```bash
Error: Missing "./compat/test-utils" specifier in "preact" package
```

This issue is related to Vite's module resolution. Vite (and Storybook) attempt to resolve React imports, but sometimes do not fully honor `@vitejs/plugin-preact` or encounter gaps in subpath aliasing. To resolve this, we may need to define manual aliases in our Vite config:

```javascript
export default defineConfig({
  ...
  resolve: {
    alias: {
      react: "preact/compat",
      "react-dom/test-utils": "preact/test-utils",
      "react-dom": "preact/compat",
      "react/jsx-runtime": "preact/jsx-runtime",
    },
  },
});

```

This ensures compatibility with packages expecting React-like imports while using Preact under the hood.

## Run Storybook

Start Storybook to verify the setup works as expected:

```bash
yarn storybook
```
